<p>Dear Current or Future Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, you’re either already working at a real estate brokerage or are interested in pursuing a career in the industry.</p>

<p>Let me make a few guesses about your current circumstances:</p>

<p>If you’re already an agent, you probably aren’t getting the support that you need in order to advance your career. If you’re new to this business, maybe you lack the right training or systems to hit the ground running. </p>

<p>Many brokerages don’t offer the leads, training, coaching, accountability, or structure required for new agents to succeed. In fact, 87% of real estate agents will fail to achieve the level of success they want and leave the industry within their first two years. </p>

<p>You might long for the kind of lifestyle that your current job can’t afford you—the freedom to maintain your life as you please outside of work, the money to support your family as well as your personal goals, and the time to make all of it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re kept awake at night because you live paycheck to paycheck and you can’t guarantee where your next check will come from, you probably long for the weight of cumbersome bills and the threat of bankruptcy to leave your shoulders. You yearn for guidance about what to do next, and when to do it.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve already sought out a solution to these problems. There are numerous companies out there that promise to deliver quality leads that you can convert to clients, therefore allowing you to grow in your business and in life. The trouble is, many of these are merely marketing mirages designed only to recruit you, not to nurture your professional and personal interests. Real estate is an expensive business to be in and if you aren’t getting the necessary support that you need to succeed, your career will be short-lived. </p>

<p>With all that in mind, here’s the thing: If you don’t do something different with your career, you’ll probably wind up like the rest of the 87% of the business—admitting defeat and leaving the industry forever. You’ll go back to a regular 9-to-5 job, forego the comfortable lifestyle you always dreamed of, and re-enter the cycle of worrying about making ends meet.</p>

<p>But don’t let your frustrations, anxieties, and past misfortunes get you down. There is a solution to your problems, and it doesn’t involve letting the real estate business chew you up and spit you</p> out.

<p>I’d like to invite you in for a discussion about becoming a member of our brokerage.</p>

<p>My name is JP Fluellen and I’ve been working in real estate since 2010. Since starting out, I realized very quickly that lead generation, systems, and processes are the keys to being successful in this business. In 2015, I scaled out my business and started building my team. Through this process, I’ve realized that our team structure is something unique to the state of Wyoming. I teach agents how to build their sphere, how to prospect, and then how to close leads.</p>

<p>Let me be a little more specific about what my team has to offer:
<ul class="indent">
<li>Frequent training and coaching sessions in both group and individual settings</li>
<li>The ability to build a strong business through your sphere, leads, and prospecting</li>
<li>A 12-week training program</li>
<li>An abundance of leads</li>
<li>No franchise fees</li>
<li>Access to our advanced CRM</li>
</ul></p>

<p>By joining our brokerage, you’ll have a turnkey real estate business. You’ll be able to show up, unlock the door, and start doing business right away.</p>

<p>After joining our team, the onboarding process starts right away. We’ll make sure we sit down, discover your motivations and expectations, and come up with a plan to achieve all those goals. We’ll also get you started on our 12-week training program, complete with specific action steps.</p>

<p>If you’re skeptical, you don’t need to just take my word for it. Let the success of our agents speak for itself, and you can make up your own mind about it. </p>

<p>One agent recently joined our team after being a solo agent for five years. She was limping along on her own, but was able to find success, stability, and structure on our team. We gave her a pathway to success and she had her best year ever within six months of joining us. </p>

<p>If you take me up on my offer to have a discussion about whether our team is right for you, I’d be glad to show you that we’re not just all talk—we can prove that what we say actually happens.</p>

<p>Then again, you could also elect to go a different route. But I’ll warn you: Other big-box brokerages often foster a dog-eat-dog atmosphere in which you’re technically a part of the brand, but you’re still left to succeed (or fail) on your own. Many will spend a lot of their time calling or texting you so they can recruit you, but once you’re there, they don’t provide the resources you need to grow your business. Others still will promise you quality leads but, in reality, will provide you with weak leads from people who aren’t really interested in buying or selling homes. This kind of route leads to a lot of pressure on you to succeed, but it doesn’t offer you the tools with which to do so.</p>

<p>If this opportunity piques your interest, I urge you to act quickly. We have the roadmap to success and we want to give it to you. In fact, I guarantee that you’ll be able to do at least one deal a month just by following our system.</p>

<p>Let’s get on this now so we can build a moat around your mindset, skill set, and most importantly, your database, allowing us to make sure you succeed in real estate regardless of what happens next. Everybody thinks that they can get into real estate, but not everybody knows how to execute. We do and we’d like to teach you how to do the same. </p>

<p>I hope to hear from you soon!</p>

<p>JP Fluellen</p>
