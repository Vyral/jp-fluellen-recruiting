The coronavirus has had a big impact on our economy, but the Titan Real Estate Team is still very much in business\! We’ve been working from home for the past two years, so we’re uniquely suited to help those who still want to buy and sell during this time. We can coordinate online transactions, offer virtual home tours, and handle anything else you’d see in a brick-and-mortar office, so keep reaching out to us if you have any real estate needs.
