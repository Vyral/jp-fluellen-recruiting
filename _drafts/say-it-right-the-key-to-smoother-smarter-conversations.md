Today, we're discussing four words that should be avoided in your script. The first two we'll address have negative implications in conversations. When you use these words, you typically either come across as unknowledgeable or inadvertently make the other person feel unintelligent. Here are the words you should never say in your script:

**1\. “Make sense”.** When explaining a concept and ending with "makes sense," it can imply that the listener should already understand, potentially making them feel inadequate.&nbsp;

**2\. “Fair enough".** This can subtly suggest that what's being discussed isn't equitable.

**{% include pullquote.html %}**

Using such phrases, often gleaned from specialized fields or sales interactions, can create disconnects in communication. Although people might not overtly express their discomfort, it's crucial to eliminate these habits. For instance, my wife pointed out that saying "make sense" made her feel undervalued. Thus, it's important to prioritize clear and respectful communication to serve clients better.

Additionally, **there's a bonus phrase to avoid: "Oh, I see."** This expression can convey a lack of enthusiasm or comprehension. Using it might signal that you're unimpressed or struggling to understand but are reluctant to seek clarification.

To enhance communication, let's reframe our language patterns. Instead of relying on these phrases, let's strive for more effective scripting, allowing us to honor our clients and their needs. If you need help with your scripting or growing your business, call or email me. I’m always happy to help.
