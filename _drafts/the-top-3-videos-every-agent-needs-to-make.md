What should I be making videos about for my database? It is extremely important to stay active with your sphere of influence (SOI) and ensure they think of you when they need to buy, sell, or invest. Creating videos is one of the best ways to stay in front of your sphere. However, many people struggle to figure out what to make a video about. To help you with this, here is a list of three types of videos that every agent needs to be making:

**1\. Introduce your team and what they can do for clients.** Talk about your team and the value they can provide. At Titan Real Estate Team, we’re dedicated to delivering exceptional results for clients’ listings. To showcase this, we create videos that will highlight our team's strengths, such as our professional photography skills, utilization of 3D walkthroughs, and effective promotion of listings both in-person and online.&nbsp;

Try to also showcase your team's expertise in marketing, their market knowledge, and their ongoing training in communication with other agents and potential buyers. Emphasizing your team's unique strengths and abilities will position you as the best choice for your clients.

**2\. Market updates.** People want to stay informed about what's happening in the market, as it's important to know when they may want to list their property, especially when the market is constantly changing or there is an influx of certain types of jobs in the community. Keeping clients informed helps align market updates with their property goals. By providing consistent and timely market updates, you can build trust and establish yourself as a trusted source, just like the news.&nbsp;

**3\. Education and advice.** Advise your clients to showcase your expertise not only in the current market trends but also in what's coming, such as changes in mortgage rates or any news that may impact the local market. Educating your sphere of influence and providing advice, such as suggesting home improvements or avoiding costly mistakes before listing, can help them save money and make informed decisions.

These three points can keep you going for many videos. Plus, if you ever run out, look at what other people are talking about, and do it better. At the end of the day, just make sure that you are a trusted source of information and that you are not forgotten. If you have any questions or need advice, don’t hesitate to reach out!
