The age-old struggle that many Realtors have questions about is how to convert leads quickly. It is crucial to have a system in place for this, but many people wonder how to create that system in the first place. In my opinion, it’s rather simple. **The three keys are to time block, make phone calls, and be consistent.** If you’re not doing those things, you will not convert quickly, and you’ll have to resort to spending too much money on hot leads without converting your old ones.&nbsp;

Make sure to create a habit of doing these things. My recommendation is to spend one or two hours a day on converting leads. This will help you stay top of mind with the people in your database. If you don’t prefer to do that, **you’ll need to have a CRM with a lot of automation.** Putting things on auto-pilot takes away some of the stress that can come with this process.&nbsp;

With all the challenges real estate agents are facing right now, it is important to stay consistent. If you have any questions about how to implement these things, call or email me, I’d be happy to hear from you\!
