Every agent wants to do as many transactions as possible; after all, it’s how you grow your business. However, the more deals you make, the more pushback you’ll face. Not every seller is easy to work with, and many of them will have strong objections about what you suggest, even if it’s what’s best for them and their sale. So how do you respond to common objections and close more deals? Today, I’m sharing a few of the most common objections you’ll hear and how you can respond to them.&nbsp;

**You can listen to my full explanation in the video above or skip to each topic using the timestamps provided:**

0:00 — Introduction

0:40 — Objection No. 1: Interest rates are too high

2:24 — Objection No. 2: I don’t want the hassle of an extended sale

3:13 — Objection No. 3: I don’t need a Realtor to sell&nbsp;

4:33 — Wrapping things up

If you have questions about any of these objections or something else, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you!
