<p style="text-align: center;"><em>How to time block successfully to ensure you’re moving business forward.</em></p>

In continuing our 100k blueprint, today I’m discussing time blocking. Time blocking means that if it’s in your schedule, then it’s cemented there. Unless the world will change somehow, someone’s having a baby, or the house is on fire, you need to stick to your schedule. **To be truly successful in the real estate business, you must time block.&nbsp;**

If you’re setting aside four hours daily for prospecting, then you need to tell yourself that those four hours are sacred and not let anything get in the way of that. I recommend turning off all phone notifications and doing anything you can to eliminate distractions; don’t have your email tab open, just pull up your CRM, and then it’s go time. Don’t let this dollar-productive time get interrupted by non-dollar producing activities.

As real estate agents, it’s easy to get distracted; we have a deal we’re working on, we’re constantly getting emails, etc. These things can wait; we truly can start and stop as we need to, not as something else dictates us. As long as you’re staying razor-focused and doing this two to three times per week for a minimum of three hours, you’ll always be pushing the needle forward.&nbsp;

If you have questions about time blocking or any other real estate topic, call or email me. I would love to help you.
