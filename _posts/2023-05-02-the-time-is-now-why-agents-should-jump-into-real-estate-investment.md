Today, we are going to talk about real estate investing. I have some tips for you on why now, even though rates are high, is a great time to invest:

**1\. Recognize the opportunity.** When most people are pulling back from the market, there is a huge opportunity for those who want to invest in today's market. We all know that interest rates are high, but this leads to more inventory and fewer buyers. As real estate agents, you should see this as an opportunity. It’s time to look at how long properties have been on the market, how many price reductions there have been, and recognize when sellers are becoming more motivated to sell.

**2\. Get your ducks in a row.** Get pre-qualified for a loan, whether it's an ARM loan, a commercial loan, or owner financing. Start having conversations with brokers and ask if sellers are willing to do owner carry.

**3\. Make lots of offers.** In this market, you may need to make multiple offers to get one that will land. If you're looking specifically for owner-carry, you might have to make even more offers.

**4\. Take action.** The opportunities in this market may only last for the next 12 to 24 months before we return to a normalized market. So, take action now to reap the rewards.
