Finding leads is a big part of the real estate game, but how do you do it? Today we’ll be talking about three of the best places for agents to look when searching out prospective homebuyers and sellers. **Some of them may be more effective than others, based on your personality and business approach, but all of them are full of value.**

Your first area to explore is your sphere of influence. This is made up of people who already know, like, and trust you, and your sphere can range from friends and family members to people at church or in your community. Your sphere even extends to general acquaintances and people you’re connected with on social media platforms.

The next area is found in your online lead generation tools. These are internet sites where you can get leads; some are paid subscriptions, while others simply require you to sign up. Google AdWords, Facebook ads, pay-per-click ads, and similar forms of advertising are other ways to gather potential leads online.

The last place to find leads is, well, all around you. The old-school approach of prospecting new leads is still incredibly effective today, and all you need to do is go out and strike up a conversation with those around you. **It may be uncomfortable, but it’s a great way to turn cold leads into warm ones.** Prospecting may include open houses, door-knocking, flyers, and contacting FSBOs or expired leads.
