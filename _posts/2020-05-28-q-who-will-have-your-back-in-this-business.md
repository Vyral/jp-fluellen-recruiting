If you’re still on the fence about joining a real estate team, here’s another reason to consider doing so.</em></p>

There are many reasons you should consider joining a real estate team, but perhaps the biggest one is that you’ll have a group of people rallying behind you—just like on a sports team—and helping you be successful.&nbsp;

**A team can keep you motivated and accountable.** If you have a question, or need guidance, we’re here to help you with real-world experience and expertise. Other team members watch out for one another, and lend assistance in the event you’re unable to contact a team leader.&nbsp;

Let’s say you’re brand-new, you haven’t done a deal, and you’re getting frustrated. You always have someone you can just call and pose questions like, “How did you do this?” or “What’s the protocol for this specific situation?” It’s easy to say “Follow the formula and you’ll succeed,” but we know reality is a little more complicated than that.&nbsp;

**We’ll give you the truth, not fluff or endless lip service**.
