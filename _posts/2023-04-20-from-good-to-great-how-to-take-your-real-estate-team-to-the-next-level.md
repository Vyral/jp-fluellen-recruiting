Today, I am excited to dive deep into what it takes to be a successful real estate team. Have you ever thought about that? To give you important things to think about, I met with Jace and Rafael of the Bowlin Group. We discussed what it takes to be successful, what gets us excited, and what gets us out of bed in the morning. If you have any questions about this discussion, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out by phone call or email. I would love to hear from you!
