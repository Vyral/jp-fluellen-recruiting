Today I want to talk about the delicate balance between cost and culture in the real estate business. **Treating your business like a business and knowing when the effort to curate great culture is costing you extra money brings this kind of conflict to the forefront.**

When thinking about why you are where you are in the business and how the culture of your team is helping you find a place to call home, you’re excited about real estate—but at what cost?

The costs can really add up, actually. If you have franchise fees, no cap, office bills, advertising costs, and administrative costs, you’re stuck in a weird spot because **the expenses you incur in the name of culture is impacting your paycheck.**

Why does it have to be that way? Why can’t you just have a space with great culture and less overhead? **That’s what agents love about working with us at eXp.** We don’t have those same marketing and office costs. Our agents make more while also enjoying that great culture.

If you want to learn more about our team or have any questions about the real estate business, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
