How should you prepare for 2022? It’s hard to believe, but the new year is just around the corner. **As things continue to change, we need to adapt,** so today I wanted to go over some tips to prepare for another fantastic year.&nbsp;

More people are working from home, and we never know if a new COVID variant will throw us back into lockdown. So we need to become mobile workers. You should include a good mix of remote and in-person work into your routine. This means becoming familiar with social media, Zoom, or anything else needed to meet your customer where they are.&nbsp;

One issue we’ve found is that some iPhone apps don’t work on Android and vice versa. If you run into this issue, **you can always use Zoom, which works on all platforms.** A creative solution we’ve found for this issue is to use [Otter.ai.](https://otter.ai/) Otter transcribes your conversations for you, so if a client wants notes after a Zoom call, you’ll have them ready.&nbsp;

We will all have to use new technologies to keep up with our customers. If you have any questions about preparing for 2022 with technology, please call or email me. I am always willing to help.
