If you follow my blog, you probably know that video marketing works. If you want to start creating video content for your database, it’s difficult to know where to start. That’s why today I want to go over what equipment I use to create high-quality videos.&nbsp;

For my webcam, I use a Logitech HD C920 Webcam. You can find one on Amazon for about $79.99. These are much better than the stock cameras that come with your computer. Some of these make me scratch my head; why do companies bother attaching such low-quality cameras to their computers? **Don’t bother with these cheap cameras.** If you get this Logitech webcam, you can have quality videos without breaking the bank.&nbsp;

My microphone is a Shure SM7B, which is $499.99 on Amazon. That may seem like a lot of money, but **this is the industry standard for radio and podcast hosts.** It has a dynamic range, so I can speak from a relaxed position or get really close for a radio-host vibe. Usually, I stay eight to 10 inches away so that I retain a warm feel without sounding echoey.&nbsp;

The interface I use is a Tascam US-42 MiniStudio, which is $147.20 on Amazon. It’s easy to use and has two microphone ports, so if I ever do an in-studio interview, I don’t have to bust out a huge interface. It has a USB port that lets it connect directly into your computer, so it couldn’t be more convenient. On top of all that,it comes with software that makes it easier to dial in the exact sound you’re looking for.&nbsp;

I also use a Gator Frameworks stand, which is $83.99 on Amazon. It has a nice weight to it, so it doesn’t bounce around when I’m filming. Speaking of which, make sure you don’t put your stand on a card table or something else insecure, or you’ll be bouncing around the whole video.&nbsp;

Finally, I use a software called vidIQ. This uses artificial intelligence to help optimize your videos for search engines.&nbsp;

**If you make quality videos on a consistent basis, you can generate organic leads.** If you have questions about starting a video blog or anything else, please call me at 307-772-1184 or email [james.fluellen@gmail.com](mailto:james.fluellen@gmail.com). I am always willing to help\!
