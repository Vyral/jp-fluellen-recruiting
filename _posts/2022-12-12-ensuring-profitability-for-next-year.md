As we move into 2023, what are you doing to ensure success in the new year? To help you get started in the right direction, I’m sharing three points to guarantee success if you do them correctly:&nbsp;

**1\. Concentrate on your lead generation activities.** Are you focusing on online, physical mail, or in-person event strategies? What are you doing with your time? Are you cold-calling and following up on leads? How are you going to keep your database full? There are many questions that you need to answer and hone in on.&nbsp;

**2\. Get in front of your sphere of influence.** You could do a pie giveaway, lean into social media more, double down on videos, and much more. How will you get your face in front of people so that they know, like, and trust you?&nbsp;

**3\. Make sure you’re focusing on things that are profitable.** If the thing you’re working on is not beneficial, then you need to stop doing it and move on to something else. However, you also need to ensure you have enough seasoning in the market. If you're going to be doing Facebook ads, running YouTube videos, posting on social media, or whatever your strategy is, if it's costing you money, do it enough times to know for sure if it's profitable. Do that for about six months to a year.&nbsp;

If you're consistent with these things and track what you're doing, then your efforts will be profitable in 2023. If you have questions or need any help, don’t hesitate to reach out\! Call or email me anytime.&nbsp;
