Contrary to popular belief, right now is a wonderful time to buy a home. Inventory is low, but there are also fewer people out there looking. **Interest rates are still historically low, and lenders are still lending.** Currently, you can take your time, negotiate carefully with sellers, and find the home you’ve been looking for.&nbsp;

One of the things you don’t want to do is wait until everyone else is buying because then you’ll have to look at more houses than you want to, and you’ll start running into multiple-offer situations. Begin your search now to bypass the commotion. Take advantage of our current market\!&nbsp;

If you have any questions about our market or real estate in general, please reach out via phone or email. I would love to help you.&nbsp;
