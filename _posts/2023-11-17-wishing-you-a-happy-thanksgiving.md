Thanksgiving is almost here. How can we cultivate more gratitude this year? For me, it's by recollecting moments that brought us joy, moments that were challenging, moments that sparked happiness, and moments that defined our uniqueness. This time of the year calls for gratitude, regardless of what eighties terminology you choose to use.

**It remains a season for thankfulness. I am genuinely grateful for each one of you**. Thank you for being a part of this journey, and I eagerly anticipate further collaborations ahead. Wishing you a joyful Thanksgiving!
