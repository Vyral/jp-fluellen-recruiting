Let’s talk about the three mistakes that most agents make at listing appointments:

**Mistake No. 1: They don’t listen enough.** When you’re at a listing appointment, you want to listen to what the seller is concerned about, what their problems are, and try to figure out how to solve those. People reach out to listing agents because they have a problem, and they want you to solve it (just like Vanilla Ice).

**Mistake No. 2: They give answers instead of asking questions.** Clients want to hear themselves talk, and the more they do, the more they feel like you care. Usually, they will give you all the answers you need on their own.

**Mistake No. 3: Not bringing a contract.** I know it’s old school, and it’s easy to get caught up in e-signing and virtual contracts. If you’re taking the time to set an appointment, go to their house, and sit there for two hours, you might as well try to close the deal. Time is the killer of all deals. The more time they have to think it over, the more likely they are to go with another agent. If you get them to sign at the appointment, they’ve committed.

I can’t tell you how many deals I’ve won this way. An easy method to close is to ask them if they’ve heard enough to make a decision. If they have and you’ve offered a service unique to your style, you will get a listing.

Make sure you share this with a friend because they need this in their lives today. If you have any questions about these three mistakes or the industry in general, feel free to call or email me. I’d love to help.
