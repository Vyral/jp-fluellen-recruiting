To all of the agents out there who think that the real estate world is ending and are wondering how they’ll survive, here’s my message to you: **Start thinking about doubling down on rental properties.** Whether it's a property that is a fixer-upper, already on the market, or you have inside knowledge of, negotiate that deal to where it might be affordable to you.

As a real estate agent, you understand that real estate is always moving. If you have money in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc, you know that they are dependent on the vitality of business. By owning real estate, you don't have to worry about all that because people will always need a home.

Real estate always goes up no matter what the market's doing. Even when the market crashed in 2008, it eventually bounced back. Invest in what you already sell, so you can have a much more in-depth conversation. You can turn current customers into investors, and you can have an additional revenue stream by having a rental property.

**If you want to learn how to cash flow those properties, we put on a great weekly mastermind called Invest Like a Titan.** It can help you get the most out of your real estate business. Simply click this link, so we can send you some information on how to not only learn from a titan but invest like one as well.

I hope that eases your mind on the money that you’ll be making, not just on the deals you're closing right now, but also on all those future rental properties you're going to own and the cash flow you'll get every single month.&nbsp;
