Today we’re going to talk about being coachable. Most agents don’t even think about this, but you need to be able to reframe your mindset, think about improving your business, and change the behaviors that are getting in the way of your full potential. That’s why I get coached in everything that I suck at.&nbsp;

For example, I hired a fitness and nutrition coach a few months ago. Since then, I lost 15 pounds and gained back seven pounds of muscle. **Hiring the right people can put you in the right direction.**

There’s a phrase, “If you pay someone, you pay attention.” If you’re paying for something, you’re probably going to be more dedicated to the results. Instead of asking people how they did something, ask them if they have a coaching program. It’s a compliment to them, and they might still offer their advice for free.

**Coaching opens you up to different perspectives** and things you wouldn’t have thought about by yourself. With my team leader coach, I’ve implemented a ton of things into my business over the last few years that have helped move it forward.&nbsp;

**Coaching is also a good way to get into a group of elites.** You can pay to be around people who are above where you’re at. Looking at those elites and trying to be in their shoes is a good way to keep yourself motivated.

Being coachable all comes back to growth. Are you willing to do what it takes to become the person you were meant to be? That's how you achieve success.
