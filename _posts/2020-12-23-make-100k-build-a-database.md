To increase your real estate business you need to build a database.

We’re continuing the conversation about how to make $100K a year in real estate. Today we’re discussing how to build a database because, **without anyone to call or talk to, you can’t build a large real estate business.**&nbsp;

There are many CRMs out there or you could use a spreadsheet, and many “gurus” out there will say “the best CRM is the one you use.” In reality, the best CRM is the one that gets you more time back and automates your business. There are a ton out there, and some can be very pricey, so if you want some CRM suggestions, feel free to reach out to me, and I’ll send you some recommendations.&nbsp;

**You actually have a database in your pocket right now—your cell phone**. CRMs often have automated tools to help you do valuable things such as download all the contacts from your phone or sync all your social media. Then it’s simply dialing for dollars. Building that list of people and numbers, having it in one manageable location, getting into it every day, writing notes, and following up are the keys to continuing to have someone to call to increase your business.&nbsp;

If you have further questions about building your database or any other topics I’ve covered, call or email me. I’d love to be your real estate resource.
