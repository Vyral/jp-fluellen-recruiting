For real estate agents to be successful on their quest toward that $100,000 goal, they need accountability. Not everyone is self-driven or consistent, so accountability is a key component of achieving success. To keep consistent with your work ethic, you could have a bet with someone that if you don’t make a certain number of calls you’ll have to give them $1,000 or meet with someone every week to go over what you’re working on, your successes, and what will drive you toward your goal. **Being accountable to someone or something will help you reach your goals and perform at a high level.&nbsp;**

You also need to be accountable to your CRM; make sure you’re in it every day, updating clients, updating what you’ve discussed with them, etc. You should also have someone you’re reporting to so they can help hold you accountable. Sometimes people can keep accountable just by saying what they’re going to do, others are more concerned with the consequences of not meeting their objectives, and some are accountable to a vision board. Putting all your goals and dreams for your real estate business onto something you can look at and reflect upon will keep you accountable.&nbsp;
