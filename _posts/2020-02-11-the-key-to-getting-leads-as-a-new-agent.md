*If you’re a new agent who’s starved for leads, your best bet is to use Facebook.*

So you’ve got your license, your brand-new office, and it’s time to get down to business. How do you get leads as a new agent?&nbsp;

**The quickest way is to go on Facebook.** Do this with intentionality and use the 369 method. In other words, privately message three people, comment on six different posts, and like nine posts total.&nbsp;

For example, you can PM one of your friends and tell them, for example:

*“Hey\! I was just driving through your neighborhood and thought of you.* Do you want to go out for a coffee?*”&nbsp;*

Once you meet, work in a real estate conversation as you’re chatting. It’s that simple\!&nbsp;
