What is reverse prospecting? Reverse prospecting is when you prospect to the new owners of the home you just closed on.

For example, if I have a house listed whose sellers are moving out of state, this presents me with either a referral opportunity or no opportunity. Those people that have bought the home are now moved into the house that I had just listed. Now you can start marketing to the new owners. Many people get busy and then forget to market to them. There's nothing worse than going through MLS later and seeing the home you sold to your buyer last year listed with somebody else.&nbsp;

**Reverse prospecting is called that because youâ€™re marketing to the other agent's buyers.** They weren't initially your client, but you know their name and you know where they live. You can sometimes pick up two or three sellers per year by reverse prospecting and sending out annual cards. You can thank them for buying the home to stay top of mind with them.

If you have any questions, contact me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
