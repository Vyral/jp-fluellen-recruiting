Why do some agents fail in the real estate business? In my opinion, it comes down to one thing: They are afraid to start.&nbsp;

When you're new to the industry, you don’t know where to begin. You’re afraid to call your family and friends, you don’t know how to start a contact list, etc. At my brokerage, Real, there’s tons of training for new agents. A lot of it’s online, but there’s in-person training too if you prefer that. I’ve seen a lot of agents take advantage of this training but never put it into practice.&nbsp;

The truth is that real estate isn’t like a nine-to-five job. You don’t get paid just by showing up and clocking in. Recently, I saw a statistic that said **97% of real estate transactions are closed on the phone.** When you’re trying to get listings and work with buyers, it’s your personality and voice that will get you where you need to be.&nbsp;

Everything you want is on the other side of fear. Whatever it takes to conquer your fears, do it. Once you take the first step, the next one will be easier. **It’s as simple as picking up your phone and getting going.** After all, even a blind man can hit a bullseye if he throws enough darts.&nbsp;

If you have questions about which brokerage you should join, how to get started in the business, or anything else, please call or email me. I am always willing to help\!
