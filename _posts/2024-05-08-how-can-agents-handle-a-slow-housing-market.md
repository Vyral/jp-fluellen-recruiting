How can you navigate a slower real estate market? The most important thing is that you don’t give up. Keeping up your morale and sticking to your plan is crucial, especially when the market is taking a downturn. Here's what you can do to stay on track:

**1\. Stick to your routines.** Reestablish your regular routines to pull yourself out of the funk. Consistency is key to maintaining productivity and positivity during challenging times.

**2\. Reconnect with your database.** Real estate doesn't grind to a halt just because the market dips. Reach out to your past clients, be genuine and transparent in your conversations, and show them that you're always available as a resource, whether they're buying, selling, or simply seeking advice.

**3\.** **Prioritize phone calls.** While social media and online presence are important, nothing beats human connections. Despite the buzz around social media strategies, studies show that phone calls have a higher probability of securing appointments. In other words, phone calls are the most efficient way to drum up business in a down market.
