To be frank, if you haven’t received a bad review before, that probably means you're not working hard enough. You can’t please everybody, and at the end of the day, you have a few options: You can cry about it, you can respond to it, or you can do nothing. In fact, I think you need to get even more bad reviews. I say that because you’re eventually going to get a whole lot more good reviews, which will bury the bad ones.&nbsp;

In these situations, if your bad reviews come from a client of yours, **I recommend sending out a postcard to address the issue.** Don't let negative reviews get to you. Keep your chin up and keep moving forward.

If you have any questions about responding to bad reviews or anything else related to managing your real estate business, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send an email. We’d love to speak with you.
