Today I want to discuss role-playing, though I know everyone hates role-plays. The moment I say “role-play,” it’s like you got chosen to be the main actor or actress in a play that you didn’t anticipate. I get it, but **the only way you’ll get better at anything is either by practicing or doing.** With role-play, you can practice in no-pressure situations, so you aren’t messing up when it counts.&nbsp;

After we’ve built our lists and profiles, it’s time to get out there and get known. The best way to be known by people is by making phone calls, learning to navigate the waters of difficult conversations, and creating meaningful conversations. Creating meaningful conversations means saying the right things with the right words.

**Role-play in real estate is all about using scripts.** Scripts are powerful because the words are deliberately chosen, so the psychology behind them creates those meaningful conversations. Practice with someone on your team or in your brokerage. We do plenty of role-playing on our team so people can gain experience; it’s just like any muscle that you exercise—the more you do it, the stronger you become.&nbsp;

If you join our team, we’ll show you how to get through the sometimes crazy conversations with complete strangers or people you barely know. **With practice, you’ll get more closings, more deals, and get closer to earning 100K.**

If you have any questions about role-playing or other real estate matters, call or email me. I would love to help guide you.
