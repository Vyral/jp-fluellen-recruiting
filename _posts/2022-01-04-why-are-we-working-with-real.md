Today I wanted to talk about why we decided to join Real. There are four good reasons why we made this transition:

**1\. They offer a new-age, technology-powered office.** We decided that we wanted to be part of a company that’s forward-thinking in the technology they use. Real has a combination of virtual offices and traditional offices. We actually have a few crash offices in Cheyanne where you can stop by and work for a couple of hours.&nbsp;

We also know that many brokerages are not keeping ahead of the curve. Real is doing a lot of cool things. For example, they have a dedicated app, and they use Workplace by Facebook.

**2\. They have competitive brokerage fees.** At Real, each agent has a cap of $12,000 per year, and the commission is an 85/15 split. 85% of every commission goes to the agent. Once the agent hits $12,000, they get 100% of the commission, and Real only changes a $225 transaction fee.&nbsp;

There are no monthly fees. The only additional fee is $250 out of your first two transactions in the year.

**3\. They are a publicly-traded company.** This means you can get stock awards. They give you a stock award when you hit your cap, reach certain goals, or attract new agents. You can also contribute a certain amount of each paycheck and get stock awards based on that. That amount is 5% before you cap for a 25% reward and 10% after you cap for a 50% reward.

**4\. They offer revenue sharing.** This is appealing because it allows us to create residual income. If you bring on an agent who hits their cap, you can make up to $4,000 per year.&nbsp;

If these sound like good reasons to you too, we would love to talk to you about joining Real. Give us a call at 307-772-1184.
