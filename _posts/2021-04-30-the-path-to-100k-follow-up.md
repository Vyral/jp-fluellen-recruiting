Today I’m sharing another tip about how to make 100K in real estate: the importance of follow-up. Harvard Business Review conducted a study on follow-up, and the majority of people in business don’t follow up, but that’s how you make money. The fortune is in the follow-up. **Most sales are made after the seventh to 13th attempt to contact a client,** and that’s how you make money in the game of leads.&nbsp;

About 46% of real estate agents don’t follow up after the first contact. If you’re spending a bunch of money on lead generation and not following up, that’s just money down the drain. Follow-up, follow-up, follow-up; that’s how you make money.

**Contact information is extremely valuable**. If you have a list, follow up with them, and if they’ve signed up for something with you, follow up until they unsubscribe. Get after it, and make those calls.

If you have questions about follow-up or any other real estate matter, call or email me. I would love to help you.
