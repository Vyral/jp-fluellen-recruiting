There’s been alarming news circulating lately. Interest rates are increasing, gas prices remain relatively high, and the war in Ukraine continues. With so much going on, our market is starting to shift, and agents need to prepare if they don’t want their business to take a hit. Here are some tips to help your real estate business not just survive but thrive in this crazy market:

**1\. Talk to more people.** Do whatever you can to reach out to a wider audience. Go to open houses, talk to other Realtors, visit your church and hand out business cards to let people know that you work as a real estate agent.

**2\. Hold a broker open at your listings.** Invite as many Realtors as you can. These gatherings can be enjoyed with wine and cheese as you talk about how you can get through this changing market.

**4\. Improve your systems.** Now more than ever is the time to clean, organize, and update your database.

**5\. Hire a coach.** If you’re unsure of how you can move forward with your career during these uncertain times, I suggest you get a coach.&nbsp;
