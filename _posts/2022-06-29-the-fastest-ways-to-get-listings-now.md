There are a lot of ways to get listings, but if you want to stay ahead of the competition, here are a few methods that you can try so you can quickly win more listings in the current market:&nbsp;

**1\. Door knocking.** It’s as literal as it sounds. Go outside and just start knocking on your neighbors’ doors. This way, you’re building connections and letting people know that you are a real estate agent.

**2\. Send mails and postcards.** The uglier the postcard, the better. Mail these to houses that you previously knocked on. Not only are you connecting to them more than once, but you’re also reinforcing your door-knocking through a mailer.&nbsp;

**3\. Call and mail a delinquent tax list.** Go to the courthouse and get a delinquent tax list. Call and mail the ones on the list.

**4\. Reach out to homes in pre-foreclosure.** You can either get this list from the courthouse or on Zillow.

**5\. Driving for dollars.** Drive around and look for dilapidated homes and houses in disrepair. You may even want to search old newspapers.

**6\. Get a list of paid-off homes.** People that have lots of equity may be looking for an opportunity to cash out, or they may have just owned the property for a long time and are looking for a change.

**7\. For sale by owners.** We will see an increase of for sale by owners as the market continues to turn. A lot of times they’ve already reached a point, where they’re fed up and don’t realize that they can get more from the listing by having a real estate agent.&nbsp;

**8\. Find landlords and out-of-state owners looking to list.** Reaching out to landlords and out-of-state-owners can be a great opportunity. Don’t just focus on single-family homes but also include multi-family homes.**&nbsp;**

We have a low-inventory market right now. Follow these simple steps to give you a headstart and get those listings. If you need more help for any of your real estate concerns, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’m happy to help\!
