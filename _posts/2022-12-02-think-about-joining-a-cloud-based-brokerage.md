If you're on the fence about what to do in 2023 and are considering making some changes in your business, know that now is a great time to do that. The year is winding down, and you may have a few deals in the pipeline, but things are probably a little bit slower in your business going into 2023. Therefore, this could be a very good time to make a move and to look at what your goals are for the next one to five years.&nbsp;

Also, have you ever thought about changing brokerages? If you want to make more money, **you should consider looking at a cloud-based brokerage** that has low fees, stock options, and revenue share.&nbsp;
