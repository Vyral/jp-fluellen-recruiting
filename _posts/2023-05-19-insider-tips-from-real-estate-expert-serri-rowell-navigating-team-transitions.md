Today, I am excited to bring you an important interview with the broker and owner of the Brand Realty Team in California, Serri Rowell. She has a lot of helpful information to share, and in our recent chat, we talked about how to transition your real estate team. There comes a moment in the history of your team where you have to have “the talk” with them, and we are here to help you do that. To hear Serri’s story and what you need to know, watch my video above.
