Here are two things to consider before getting your real estate license:

**1\. Classes.** What you’ll have to do depends on your state. Here in Wyoming, you can take in-person real estate classes over 10 days, self-paced classes, or a combination of some online and some in person. You’re required to do 140 hours of real estate education before you get licensed. Then you’ll take a test that lasts between two and three hours. In our area, you need about $3,000 saved up to cover costs, fees for classes, and the things you need to sign up for after the test.

**2\. Fingerprints.** You need to get your fingerprints taken to be a real estate agent. Make sure to do this beforehand. This is the main thing that frustrates new agents; you’re ready, and everything’s paid for, but then you have to wait three to four weeks for your fingerprints to be processed. Go down to the Sheriff’s Department and get it done as soon as you decide to get your license.&nbsp;

If you have questions about getting your license or any other real estate matter, call or email me. I would love to speak with you.
