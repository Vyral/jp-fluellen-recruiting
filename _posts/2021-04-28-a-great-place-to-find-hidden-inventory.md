There’s hidden inventory we’re all aware of in our real estate market, we just don’t utilize it often enough—especially in this crazy world we’re living in right now where it’s so hard to find houses to buy. **The inventory I’m talking about is FSBO (for sale by owner) homes.**&nbsp;

Let's be honest: ‘FSBO’ becomes a four-letter word, and we don’t utilize it as much as we could. All you have to do is be brave enough to ask the seller, “Hey, if I bring you a buyer, are you willing to pay a commission?” These homes are really easy to find. You can just Google ‘FSBO’ and several resources pop up allowing you to search further. You can also find FSBO homes on Zillow. You can either find them yourself or have an assistant text you these listings in their spare time. (We have that unique opportunity here at the Titan Real Estate Team.)

In any case, **take advantage of these listings by reaching out to the sellers and asking them if they’re willing to take an offer from a pre-qualified buyer.** Most of the time they are, because they’re just trying to save some money on the transaction, so they’re usually willing to pay your commission up to some degree. As long as you and the other party can agree on that, you’ll get yourself an off-market property for some lucky client.&nbsp;

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
