How much effort do you have to put in to be successful?&nbsp;

Well, **the numbers don’t lie—there’s a math equation you need to know to see success.** If you make 100 calls and have at least 10 meaningful conversations, that will lead to at least one appointment. If you’re good at what you’re doing and have good training, that one appointment should lead to one closing.&nbsp;

If you’re able to get in front of someone and talk intelligently about real estate, that person will work with you. Earlier in this series, we talked about time blocking, and that’s key to having those meaningful conversations. If you have 10 meaningful conversations, that’s one meaningful conversation for every working day of the week. If you can have one meaningful conversation for every working day of the week, you should close two to three deals per month once you get into the habit of the continuous workflow of your business.&nbsp;

If you continue to do that and have those meaningful conversations, you’re going to have a successful real estate business. You can close just one deal a month and still make livable wages in this business; imagine what would happen if you can do that two or three times over. **The key is treating your real estate career like a business.** It’s not just a job—it’s a lifestyle.&nbsp;

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help, and I’ll catch you on the next video\!
