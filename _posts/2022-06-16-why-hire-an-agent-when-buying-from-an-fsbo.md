Have you ever wanted to buy a home from a for sale by owner (FSBO)? If you’re considering purchasing a home in this market, here are a few reasons why you should still get a real estate agent even if you’re planning to buy from an FSBO:

**1\. The owner may not allow home inspections.** When you buy a home from a for sale by owner, they most likely won’t let you do home inspections. A home inspection is an important part of the home-buying process that you should not skip. It’s the chance for you to see if there’s anything wrong with the property.

**2\. Sellers can become emotional during transactions.** Sellers can sometimes take it personally when you point out what’s wrong with their property. This may cause problems for the transaction.

**3\. You won’t have someone who will look out for your best interests.** Real estate agents have the experience to make sure the transaction doesn’t become personal and that you can properly do your home inspections. Without an agent, you won’t have a representative who can look out for your best interest.

**4\. You can avoid extra costs.** You want to hire someone who knows the ins and outs of the home-buying process so you can avoid extended transactions and any extra costs after the closing.&nbsp;

If you want to have a smoother home-buying experience, it’s always a good idea to hire a qualified real estate agent who can help you navigate the transaction. If you have more questions about buying a home from a for sale by owner, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I’ll be happy to help\!
